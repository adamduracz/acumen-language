#sidebar TableOfContents

= Getting Started =

 # [http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Setup Install sbt] (simple build tool)
 # Checkout the repository; in a unix shell type:
   {{{
   svn co https://svn.rice.edu/r/rap/project/Acumen-Scala
   }}}
 # Launch sbt; in a unix shell positioned in `Acumen-Scala` type:
   {{{
   sbt
   }}}
   and wait until the prompt appears (this will take some time only once).
 # Get the dependencies; in the sbt console type:
   {{{
   update
   }}}
   and wait for a while (this has to be done only once).
 # Compile acumen; in the sbt console type:
   {{{
   compile
   }}}
 # (Optional) Test acumen; in the sbt console type:
   {{{
   test
   }}}
 # Run acumen GUI; in the sbt console type:
   {{{
   run
   }}}
 # Edit the code 
 # Compile again ...

= Development Cycle =

Automatic compilation in the background is enabled by typing
{{{
~ compile
}}}
in the sbt console.

See [http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/RunningSbt sbt documentation] for more options.

= Project Structure (or "where are the examples?") =

The project structure follows the one proposed by sbt which in turn follows that of Maven:

{{{
 src/
    main/
      resources/
         <files to include in main jar here>
      scala/
         <main Scala sources>
      java/
         <main Java sources>
    test/
      resources
         <files to include in test jar here>
      scala/
         <test Scala sources>
      java/
         <test Java sources>
}}}

In particular, the example files are situated in:
{{{
src/main/resources/acumen/examples
}}}
