== version 10.09.30 (September 30th 2010) ==

  * it is now possible to create objects inside Main's private section; fixes [http://code.google.com/p/acumen-language/issues/detail?id=25&can=1&sort=status bug 25]
  * `~=` is now interpreted; fixes [http://code.google.com/p/acumen-language/issues/detail?id=23&can=1&sort=status bug 23]
  * it is now possible to move one's direct child to one of its children; fixes [http://code.google.com/p/acumen-language/issues/detail?id=22&can=1&sort=status bug 22]
  * semicolons are now accepted at the end of an instruction block, but are optional; addresses [http://code.google.com/p/acumen-language/issues/detail?id=20&can=1&sort=status request 20]
  * variable and class identifiers are now free to start with either a lowercase or an upprcase letter; they may also contain underscores; addresses [http://code.google.com/p/acumen-language/issues/detail?id=19&can=1&sort=status request 19]
  * Exception generation was not localized in Acumen's internal source code. This made it harder to keep manuals and tutorials consistent, and to check user-level error reports for consistency and style. This has been fixed by localizing in one place where the text for user-level error reports is generated; addresses [http://code.google.com/p/acumen-language/issues/detail?id=17&can=1&sort=status request 17]
  * it is now allowed to write `if condition statements end` (without an `else` clause); addresses [http://code.google.com/p/acumen-language/issues/detail?id=16&can=1&sort=status request 16] 
  * no more mode passed to Main: use private variable instead; addresses [http://code.google.com/p/acumen-language/issues/detail?id=12&can=1&sort=status request 12]
  * the convention is now that Main's first argument is called `simulator`; addresses [http://code.google.com/p/acumen-language/issues/detail?id=11&can=1&sort=status request 11]
  * gensym is now local (as opposed to accessing a global counter): objects ids are now hierarchical (e.g. #1.0.2)
  * the application logic of the UI is now clean and separate from the interaction/drawing code
  * switch from `SwingWorker` to actor based concurrency for the UI
  * turned names into atoms (huge speedup)
  * conformance tests of reference and parallel interpreters are run on every example (`ant test`)
  * added a benchmark command-line option for parallel interpreter (`bench`)
  * added a parallel interpreter (command-line only for now)
  * got rid of explicit "init" in the UI
  * merged play and pause buttons
  * several little fixes I don't remember
